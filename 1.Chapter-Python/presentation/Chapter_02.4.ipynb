This allows a new class to be defined based upon an existing class as the starting point. In object-oriented terminology, the existing class is typically described as the **base class**, **parent class**, or **superclass**, while the newly defined classs is known as the **subclass** or **child class**.\n",

    "### Abstract Base Class\n",
    "In classic object-oriented terminology, we say a class is an **abstract base class** if its only purpose is to serve as a base class though inheritance. More formally, an abstract base class is one that cannot be directly instantiated, while **concrete class** is one that can be instantiated. By this definition, our `Progression` class is technically concrete, although we essentially designated it as an abstract base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In statically typed languages such as Java and C++, an abstract base class serves as a formal type that may guarantee one or more **abstract methods**. This provides support for polymorphism, as a variable may have an abstract base class as its declared type, even though it refers to an instance of a concrete subclass. Because there are no declared types in Python, this kind of polymorphism can be accomplished without the need for a unifying abstract class. For this reason, there is not as strong a tradition of defining abstract base classes in Python, although Python's `abc` module provides support for defining a formal abstract base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our reason for focusing on abstract base classes in our study of data structures is that Python's `collections` module provides several abstract base classes that assist when defining custom data structures that share a common interface with some of Python's built-in data structures. These rely on an object-oriented software design pattern known as the **template method pattern** The template method pattern is when an abstract base class provides concrete behaviors that rely upon calls to other abstract behaviours. In that way, as soon as a sublclass provides definitions for the missing abstract behaviors, the inherited concrete behaviors are well defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a tangible example, the `collections.Sequence` abstract base class defines behaviors common to Python's `list`, `str`, and `tuple` classes, as sequences that support element access via an integer index. More so, the `collections.Sequence` class provides concrete implementations of methods, `count`, `index` and `__contains__` that can be inherited by any class that provides concrete implementations of both `__len__` and `__getitem__`."

    "As we can see, since `Sequence` is an abstract Class, not an concrete class, so that it cannot be instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation relies on two advanced Python techniques. The first is that we declare `ABCMeta` class of the `abc` module as a **metaclass** of our `Sequence` class. *A meta class is different from a superclass*, in that it provides a template for the class definition itself. Specifically, the `ABCMeta` declaration assures that the constructor for the class raises an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second advanced technique is the use of the `@abstractmethod` decorator immediately before the `__len__` and `__getitem__` methods are declared. That declares these two particular methods to be abstract, meaning that we do not provide an implementation within our Sequence base class, but that we expect any concrete subclasses to support those two methods. Python enforces this expectation, by disallowing instantitation for any subclass that does not override the abstract methods with concrete implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We emphasize that if a subclass provides its own implementation of an inherited behaviors from a base class, the new definition overrides the inherited one. This technique can be used when we have the ability to provide a more efficient implementation for a behavior than is achieved by the generic approach. "
