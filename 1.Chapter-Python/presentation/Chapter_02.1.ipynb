    "## 2.1 Goals, Principles, and Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.1 Object-Oriented Design Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Software implementations should achieve robustness, adaptability, and reusability. \n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"..\\images\\Fig2.1.png\" alt=\"Software implementation\" width=\"600\" class=\"center\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Robustness**: capable of handling unexpected inputs that are not explicitly defined for its application (not only a program producing the right output for all the anticipated inputs in the program’s\n",
    "application). <br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adaptability**: be able to evolve over time in response to changing conditions in its\n",
    "environment (also called evolvability). Related to this concept is portability, which\n",
    "is the ability of software to run with minimal change on different hardware and\n",
    "operating system platforms. <br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reusability**: the same code should be usable as a component of different systems in various\n",
    "applications. Developing quality software can be an expensive enterprise, and its\n",
    "cost can be offset somewhat if the software is designed in a way that makes it easily\n",
    "reusable in future applications.<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.2 Object-Oriented Design Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "Chief among the principles of the object-oriented approach, which are intended to\n",
    "facilitate the goals outlined above, are the following (see Figure 2.2):\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"..\\images\\Fig2.2.png\" alt=\"Software implementation\" width=\"600\" class=\"center\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modularity**: different components of a software system are divided into separate functional units. \n",
    "As a real-world analogy, a house or apartment can be viewed as consisting of\n",
    "several interacting units: electrical, heating and cooling, plumbing, and structural.\n",
    "Rather than viewing these systems as one giant jumble of wires, vents, pipes, and\n",
    "boards, the organized architect designing a house or apartment will view them as\n",
    "separate modules that interact in well-defined ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Python’s standard libraries include severals modules: the *math module*, which provides definitions for key mathematical constants and functions, and the *os module*, which provides support for interacting with the operating system.\n",
    "    - *Robustness* is greatly increased because it is easier to test and debug separate components before they are integrated into a larger software system.\n",
    "    - The structure imposed by modularity also helps enable software *reusability*. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Abstraction**:  distill a complicated system down to its most fundamental parts. Applying the abstraction paradigm to the design of data structures gives rise to abstract data types (ADTs):  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - A mathematical model of a data structure that specifies the type of data stored, the operations supported on them, and the types of parameters of the operations: an ADT specifies what each operation does, but not how it does it.\n",
    "    - Python  supports abstract data types using a mechanism known as an *Abstract Base Class (ABC)*. An abstract base class cannot be instantiated but it defines one or more common methods that all implementations of the abstraction must have.\n",
    "    <!-- \n",
    "      - An ABC is realized by one or more concrete classes that inherit from the abstract base class while providing implementations for those method declared by the ABC. Python’s abc module provides formal support for ABCs, although we omit such declarations for simplicity. We will make use of several existing abstract base classes coming from Python’s collections module, which includes definitions for several common data structure ADTs, and concrete implementations of some of those abstractions.\n",
    "    -->\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encapsulation**:  Different components of a software system should not reveal the internal details of their\n",
    "respective implementations.  The only constraint on the programmer of a component\n",
    "is to maintain the public interface for the component, as other programmers will\n",
    "be writing code that depends on that interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Encapsulation yields *robustness* as it allows the implementation details of parts of a program to\n",
    "change without adversely affecting other parts, thereby making it easier to fix bugs.\n",
    "    - Encapsulation yields *adaptability* as it allows the implementation add new functionality with relatively local changes to a component.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1.3 Design Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Designing good code  requires the effective use of object-oriented design techniques.\n",
    "Computing researchers and practitioners have developed a variety of organizational concepts and methodologies for designing quality object-oriented software: **A design pattern describes a solution to a “typical” software design\n",
    "problem**. \n",
    "\n",
    "[//]: <A pattern provides a general template for a solution that can be applied in many different situations. >\n",
    "- It describes the main elements of a solution in an abstract way that can be specialized for a specific problem at hand. It consists of: \n",
    "    - a name, which identifies the pattern; \n",
    "    - a context, which describes the scenarios for which this pattern can be applied; \n",
    "    - a template, which describes how the pattern is applied; and\n",
    "    - a result, which describes and analyzes what the pattern produces.\n",
    "\n",
    "These design patterns fall into two groups:\n",
    "- Patterns for solving **algorithm design problems**, and \n",
    "- Patterns for solving **software engineering problems**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some algorithm design patterns: \n",
    "* Recursion\n",
    "* The greedy method \n",
    "* Divide-and-conquer \n",
    "* Prune-and-search, also known as decrease-and-conquer \n",
    "* Brute force\n",
    "* Dynamic programming \n",
    "\n",
    "There are about 26 software engineering design currently discovered that can be classified into 3 types:\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Creational: These patterns are designed for class instantiation. They can be either class-creation patterns or object-creational patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Structural: These patterns are designed with regard to a class's structure and composition. The main goal of most of these patterns is to increase the functionality of the class(es) involved, without changing much of its composition.<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Behavioral: These patterns are designed depending on how one class communicates with others.\n",
